title: To All the Buses I've Taken Before
---

To the 7D, thanks for taking me to class my first term.
When I didn't know any better, you had my back, and even though I stopped taking you, you'll always have a place in my heart.

To the 7E, thanks for being my daily driver for the past six months. 
You may have been perpetually overcrowded, but you were always there when I needed you, and I could always trust you to get me to school right on time, rain or shine.

To the 91, thanks for taking me home after late nights spent studying at E7 or destressing at Foodie Fruitie.
Whenever my friends would ask "How are you getting home?", I could point to you and trust you to take me there safe and sound.

To the 7B, thanks for being such a consistent ride home.
Some days, when I need comfort, I'll close my eyes and relive waiting for you under the soft yellow glow of streetlamps on a slow autumn night, the smell of rain in the air, the gentle breeze cradling and insulating me from the stresses and deadlines of this fast-paced world.

To the 200, you've been replaced by the iON --- _you've grown up_.
And although you're a lot less convenient for me now, I'll never forget the friends I made and the conversations I had riding you.
So thanks for that.
I'll miss you.

To the 9 --- well, you're still here, just as the 19 now.
You got me to school and you got me back, and as my most convenient option now, I guess we're going to get to know each other a lot better over the next few months.

Thanks for everything.
