I like to play with Blender in my spare time. Here's some of the stuff I've made:

{% include youtube.html ID="WHouZasu_8E" caption="A Jon Bois-esque video I made for one of my courses, animated and edited in Blender." %}

{% include image.html src="/assets/images/blender/stand.png" alt="On the left, a screenshot of Blender showing a 3D model with a thick base and a deep vertical slit on the top. On the right, two physical copies of the model, with pieces of paper stuck in the slits." caption="My first foray into 3D printing - a custom, low-profile sign holder for an event." %}

{% include image.html src="/assets/images/blender/car.png" alt="A black sports car in a dark, foggy room, illuminated only by white fluorescent lighting from above, and cyan and magenta light bars on the sides." caption="Sportscar model courtesy of Yasutoshi Mori (@MirageYM), licensed under CC-BY 2.0" %}

{% include image.html src="/assets/images/blender/office-oasis-day.png" alt="Office Oasis (day)" %}

{% include image.html src="/assets/images/blender/office-oasis-night.png" alt="Office Oasis (night)" %}
