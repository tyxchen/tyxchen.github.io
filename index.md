# Hi, I'm <a href="#" class="clicky trianglify" data-cell-size="16" style="opacity:1">Terry</a>.

I'm a master's student at [ÉTS](https://www.etsmtl.ca) under the supervision of [Prof. Adrien Gruson](https://profs.etsmtl.ca/agruson/).
My undergrad was spent at [UWaterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca), where I worked with [Prof. Toshiya Hachisuka](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~thachisu) on the walk-on-boundary method.
I also worked with [Prof. Samuel Wong](https://swong.ca/) on using machine learning in computational forestry and protein structure prediction.

My primary research interests are in improving physically-based rendering algorithms from both the forward and inverse perspectives.
I'm also interested in finding ways to help artists improve their workflows using differentiable rendering.
