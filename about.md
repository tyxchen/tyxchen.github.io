Hi there! My name is Terry Chen, and I'm a masters student in computer science at École de technologie supérieure, studying computer graphics under the supervision of [Adrien Gruson](https://profs.etsmtl.ca/agruson/). 
Previously, I attended the University of Waterloo from 2018 to 2023, where I double majored in Computer Science and Statistics. 

This personal site is mostly focused on my past web development adventures and projects. At some point, I'll update this to reflect my current research, but for now enjoy this look into the past. 

When I'm not busy with work or school, you can find me watching hockey, playing softball, or practicing piano and guitar.
