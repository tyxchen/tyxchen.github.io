Hi there! My name is Terry Chen, and I am studying Computer Science at the University of Waterloo, class of 2022.
Here on my little corner of the internet, you'll find my personal portfolio and various ramblings on software, sports, and life.

In the past, I've used my web development skills to build [a theme database](/portfolio#everything-dojo), [club websites](/portfolio#mss-csec), and [chemistry visualizations](/portfolio#chem-visualizations).

Right now, I'm focusing my efforts on statistics and systems programming.
My current side project is a Lisp parser in Rust, through which I am learning language design and implementation.
In the future, I plan to look into bioinformatics and sports analytics as bases for my side projects.

When I'm not busy with work or school, you can find me watching hockey, playing softball, practicing piano and guitar, or volunteering at my church.
